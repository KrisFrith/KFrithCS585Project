Alpha Version 1.0

Note:  Class Execute Shell Command has been shown to work in Mac environment in one instance, 
but not in Windows, so currently moved to a future version for completion.

Purpose of project: To clone a public Git repository and analyze it for test coverage.

The tool currently uses Egit to import the source code.  The file directory is currently hard-coded.
To iterate trough classes and methods, in order to get names of classes and methods and numbers of methods
overall and per class.

To use the reflection library, this project must depend upon the project being tested. To do so,
right click on the project name (in Eclipse), select BuildPath, configure BuildPath, and then under project
tab, add the project you are testing.

This project enforces naming conventions for testing.  If test classes are not named as sourceClassTest,
they will not be recognized as tests.  If constructor tests do not have "Constructor" in them, they are
also not recognized.
